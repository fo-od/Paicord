## Sponsor

If you've enjoyed using Paicord, I would apprecate a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/llsc12)! I work on Paicord in my free time outside of Uni work, so it would be awesome if you chipped in. Monthly sponsors over $5 get custom profile badges! Refer to sponsor page for information.

Paicord uses modified versions of [DiscordBM](https://github.com/DiscordBM/DiscordBM) and [SwiftMarkdownParser](https://github.com/sciasxp/SwiftMarkdownParser). These other references are mentioned since I read their code to learn from others.

And of course, [Discord Userdoccers and its maintainers](https://docs.discord.food) helped massively with their unofficial documentation and direct help.
